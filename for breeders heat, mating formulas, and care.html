<h3 style="color:blue">(Heat Info Of Goat)</h3>
          <p><Big>after every 21 days goats comes in heat and its duration lasts for 36 hours,sometimes goats behaves like male cross
          <br>actions and there will be an increase in goat peeing.Goats also starts to get attracted to males,now after 3 weeks
        <br>if your goat has no signs like this that means that she has conceived</Big></p>
         <h3 style="color:red">Signs Of Goat pregnancy</h3>
         <h3 style="color:grey">1.Failure To Return To Heat</h3>
         <p><Big>A goat that has not been successfully bred typically comes back into heat on her next cycle.
           <br>The heat cycle of any individual doe can be anywhere from 17 days to about 25 days,
           <br>so knowing the length of each doe’s heat cycle will tell you when to watch for her next estrus.
            <br>A doe that settles (gets pregnant) will not come back into typical heat.
            <br>She may show some signs of estrus on the next cycle or two,
            <br>but they won’t be as strong as usual.
            <br>If she’s visiting a buck, she will display little interest in him.
            <br>Note that if a pregnant doe resorbs her embryo(s),
            <br>she may come back into heat on her regular cycle or as much as six weeks after being bred.</Big></p>
            <h3 style="color:grey">2. Appetite Goes Up, Milk Production Goes Down.</h3>
            <p><Big>The appetite of a pregnant doe gradually increases.
              <br>If she’s being milked, her milk production may gradually decrease as her udder recedes.
              <br>If a milker does not stop production on her own,
              <br>stop milking her two months before the kids are due, to give her body a rest.
              <br>Since the gestation period for goats is approximately 150 days,
              <br>stop milking no longer than 120 days after the doe was bred.</Big></p>
              <h3 style="color:grey">3. The Doe’s Belly Tightens.</h3>
              <p><Big>Two weeks after a doe is successfully bred, her belly will tighten,
                <br>a feature you can detect by firmly pressing your fingers against her belly just in front of her udder.
                <br>A settled doe’s belly will feel tense and tight.
                 <br>An unbred, or open, doe’s belly will feel soft.
                 <br>Note that a doe that is not used to being handled may tense her belly out of nervousness,
                 <br>even if she isn’t pregnant.</Big></p>
                  <h3 style="color:grey">4. The Doe’s Personality Changes.</h3>
                 <p><Big>Thanks to the hormone progesterone, a settled doe often experiences a personality reversal,
                  <br>usually within about two weeks.
                  <br>If the doe is normally friendly toward you, she may become standoffish.
                  <br>A doe that is typically shy may suddenly become your best friend,
                   <br>eager for back scratches. This change is temporary,
                   <br>lasting only for the duration of the goat pregnancy.</Big></p>
                   <h3 style="color:grey">5. The Buck’s Personality Changes.</h3>
                   <p><Big>If the doe is still housed with the breeder buck, the buck may become aggressive toward the bred doe.
                    <br>An otherwise gentlemanly buck may, for instance, start keeping the doe away from the grain feeder.
                    <br>If you notice how the buck normally acts toward each doe, you will be able to detect any change in his behavior.</Big></p>
                     <h3 style="color:grey">6. The Doe’s Barrel Swells</h3>
                     <p><Big>Some pregnant does start filling out almost right away.
                      <br>Others don’t show until a couple of months after being bred,
                      <br>sometimes appearing to balloon overnight.
                       <br>If you measure each doe’s girth (barrel diameter just behind the front legs) at the time of breeding,
                       <br>and then regularly each month, you can detect this gradual increase in size.</Big></p>
                       <h3 style="color:grey">7. The Doe’s Shape Changes.</h3>
                       <p><Big>As her fetus(es) develop, the doe’s right side may stick out farther than the left side.
                        <br>Swelling on the left side indicates a full rumen, although when a doe carries two or more kids,
                         <br>they may press into the rumen and cause her to bulge out on the left as well as on the right,
                         <br>giving the doe a boat-like appearance. Some does, especially those that have kidded before,
                          <br>don’t swell at the side, but instead develop a saggy belly. Other does, especially older ones,
                          <br>barely show at all until some six weeks before goat labor begins</Big></p>
                          <h3 style="color:grey">8. The Doe Snores.</h3>
                          <p><Big>All goats sometimes snore when they’re resting, especially while taking a siesta on a hot summer afternoon.
                            <br>But during goat pregnancy they snore more and louder than usual.
                            <br>Nothing is funnier than approaching a goat barn to hear a chorus of loudly snoring pregnant does.</Big></p>
                             <h3 style="color:grey">9. The Doe’s Udder Swells.</h3>
                             <p><Big>The udder of a goat that has kidded in the past may not begin to fill out until about a month,
                              <br>or sometimes only days,
                              <br>before she’s due to kid. If this is the doe’s first goat pregnancy,
                               <br>her udder should begin to gradually develop about six weeks after she settled and become nicely 
                               <br>rounded by 12 weeks into gestation.</Big></p>
                               <h3 style="color:grey">10. The Kids Move.</h3>
                               <p><Big>Three-and-a-half to four months after a doe has settled, you may be able to detect movement 
                                <br>of the kid(s) she is carrying.
                                 <br>Sometimes you can see them kicking against her side. If you press your spread hands against her 
                                  <br>right side and belly, ahead of the udder, you may feel the movement,
                                  <br>especially if the doe is carrying more than one kid.
                                  <br>If you like surprises, you could always use the wait-and-see method of identifying goat pregnancy.
                                  <br>You will know your doe was successfully bred when kids suddenly appear in your barn.</Big></p>
                                  <h3 style="color:blue">(For Buck Heat Control)</h3>
                                  <p><Big>if your buck is on maximum heat and disturbing you and your goats then you can make a formula with home remedies
                                    <br>to decrease his heat, I have used this formula on my bucks and it has perfect result.</Big></p>
                                  <h3 style="color:purple">Formula For Buck Heat Control</h3>

                                     <h3 style="color:blue">(Goat Diet/Crossing/Heat Rules)</h3>
                                     <p><Big>When goat is in heat she decreases her feed intake and she wont increase her feed intake until she get 
                                      <br>crossed,after getting crossed she will
                                       <br>automatically increase her feed intake day by day, for the prevention of heat after getting crossed use 
                                       <br>black chickpea with mustard oil.</Big></p>
                                       <h3 style="color:grey">Prior to Breeding:</h3>
                                       <p><Big>Pregnant goat care begins before you even breed your goat! First, be sure she’s at a healthy weight before 
                                        <br>you have her bred.
                                        <br> Overweight goats have a harder time getting pregnant and may have a more uncomfortable pregnancy while 
                                        <br>underweight goats will have difficulty putting on any weight once they are growing a baby, and even a 
                                        <br> harder time gaining once they are in milk.
                                        <br>So your best bet is to get them to an optimal weight before you breed them. I, personally, like to 
                                        <br>have a little excess weight on my heavier milkers before I breed them because
                                        <br>I know once they are in milk it will be nearly impossible to increase or even maintain weight.
                                        <br>Always important for your goats is adequate shelter from the wind, rain, or snow as well as from extreme sun and heat.
                                        <br>But it’s even more important to be sure they can stay comfortable during the five months they are pregnant.
                                        <br>In addition to adequate shelter, you’ll also want your doe to be as healthy as possible before she is bred.
                                        <br>Keeping her up-to-date on vaccinations and worming is especially important before her body goes through the stress of a pregnancy.
                                        <br>I’ve made the mistake before of not handling my yearlings quite enough before they are bred, and then once they
                                        <br>kid I find it really hard to work with these new mamas with their raging hormones and confusion about having a little one (or more) to care for.</Big></p>
                                         <h3 style="color:grey">Once Bred:</h3>
                                         <p><Big>Once your doe is bred it will be more important than ever that she has high quality hay or alfalfa as well
                                            as free-choice minerals.
                                            Healthy mamas make healthy babies! If you want to confirm your doe’s pregnancy you can do this at 30 days 
                                            with a blood test (sample sent to a lab) or with an ultrasound at 40 days post-breeding.
                                            I like to do the blood test at 30 days and at the same time have the lab run a CAE test.
                                            If you’re not familiar with caprine arthritis encephalitis, this is an incurable disease that is eventually fatal to goats.
                                            The only way to get it out of your herd is to prevent it in the first place.</Big></p>
                                            <h3 style="color:grey">Two Months Prior To Kidding:</h3>
                                            <p><Big>If your doe is still in milk when she is bred, it’s fine to continue milking her for two or three more months,
                                               but she should be dry for the last two months of her pregnancy so that all that energy can go to babies.
                                              Many breeders like to dry treat does with an intra-mammary infusion to prevent mastitis upon kidding.
                                              If you do this, just remember to consider the milk and meat withdrawal times for this medication.
                                               And since pregnant goat care includes good conditioning, this is also a good time to adjust her food intake 
                                               depending on how her weight looks at this stage.
                                               If a little underweight, you may start adding a bit more to her diet.
                                               If she’s looking extremely large, don’t cut her diet back too far,
                                               but don’t overdo it either as this will add to her discomfort and can make for large babies that may be harder to deliver.</Big></p>
                                               <h3 style="color:grey">One Month Before Kidding:</h3>
                                                <p><Big>for your doe has not been eating grain up to this point in her pregnancy, this may be a time to gradually
                                                   introduce it.
                                                   Once she is in milk, she will need a lot of extra calories to maintain her milk production,
                                                   but adding too much grain at one time can lead to bloat or other problems, so use the last month to gradually
                                                    get her used to a higher volume of richer food.
                                                   It’s also a good idea to give your doe a CD&T vaccine at this point. Not only is she probably due for her own 
                                                   semi-annual booster,
                                                   but giving it about a month before kidding will give her kids an added immunity boost until they are old enough
                                                   to get their own vaccinations.</Big></p>
                                                   <h3 style="color:grey">One Week Before Kidding:</h3>
                                                   <p><Big>These next few tips are less about pregnant goat care itself as they are about getting yourself ready for 
                                                     the upcoming kidding.
                                                     The better prepared you are the more likely that your doe will have a calm and successful kidding experience.
                                                     First, be sure to clean and prepare a kidding stall so that she is comfortable and the kids are born in a
                                                      somewhat sanitary environment.
                                                     I prefer not to use shavings as the bedding for the stalls as the babies can inhale the fine wood chips and the 
                                                     shavings will also stick to the wet newborns.
                                                      Instead, use clean fresh straw for your bedding. You’ll also want to be sure your kidding kit is stocked with 
                                                      all the items you might need,
