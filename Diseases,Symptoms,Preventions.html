    <h1 style="color:blue"> Diseases</h1>
    <h2 style="color:grey">Why Diseases Attack?</h2>
    <p><Big>Diseases attack because goats acquire infection by licking the aborted fetuses, placentas, newborn kids,<br>vaginal discharges,
      or by consumption of feed contaminated with these infectious materials.<br>Milkers can also spread the infection through unsanitary milking practices.</Big></p>
      <hr>
       <h2 style="color:blue"><B>(Bacterial Diseases)</B></h2>
       <h3 style="color:grey">Anthrax</h3>
       <p><Big>Anthrax is a peracute, acute or subacute, often fatal disease of animals including goats.<br>
          In goats the disease is mainly characterized by septicaemia, splenomegaly and gelatinous <br>infiltration of subcutaneous or subserosal tissues. <br>
          The disease is commonly known as woolsorter’s disease, splenic fever, charbon, and milzbrand.</Big></p><img  width="320" height="240"src="image27.jpg" alt="image27.jpg">
          <h3 style="color:grey">Brucellosis</h3>
          <p><Big>Caprine brucellosis is an infectious zoonotic disease having substantial economic impact on both livestock and human.<br>
            Caprine brucellosis is reported since ancient days,<br>
            which was most likely to be associated with consumption of raw milk or derivatives of infected sheep or goats<br>.
          The causative agent is Brucella species mainly B. melitensis that are small, non-motile, non-spore forming, gram-negative coccobacilli.
           <br>Goats are also susceptible to infection, particularly when housed in close proximity with infected cattle however,
           <br>they do not sustain the infection in the herd</Big></p><img src="image28.jpg" alt="image28.jpg">
           <h3 style="color:grey">Enterotoxemia</h3>
           <p><Big>C. perfringens is worldwide in distribution and is found in soil, feces, and in the intestinal tracts of animals and humans.
              <br>C. perfringens types B, C and D may survive in soil as spores for several months.
              <br>C. perfringens type A constitutes a part of the normal intestinal flora and is widely dispersed in soil.
              <br>Overcrowding and prolonged confinement may increase the spread and severity of the conditiion</Big></p><img src="image30.jpg" alt="image30.jpg">
              <h3 style="color:grey">Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP)</h3>
              <p><Big>Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) is a highly contagious and rapidly spreading mycoplasmal disease of goat,
                <br>occasionally sheep and wild ruminants.
                <br>CCPP is characterized by severe sero-fibrinous pleuropneumonia,
                <br>very high morbidity (100%), and mortality (80–100%) and results in heavy economic losses.</Big></p><img src="image29.jpg" alt="image29.jpg">
                <h3 style="color:grey">Foot Rot</h3>
                <p><Big>Foot rot in goats. Signs: Foot rot is a more aggressive progression of foot scald,
                  <br>an inflammation between the toes that usually affects one foot. The common lesion seen is a moist,
                  <br>raw infection of the skin between the toes that becomes painful. Foot rot can occur in one or more feet,
                  <br>causing severe lameness</Big></p><img src="image31.jpg" alt="image31.jpg">
                  <h3 style="color:grey">Mastitis</h3>
                  <p><Big>Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland (udder) that causes a chemical and physical reaction in milk produced by goats.
                    <br>It is more frequent in dairy and meat goats raised under intensive and semi-intensive manage- ment practices.</Big></p><img src="image32.jpg" alt="image32.jpg">

                  <h3 style="color:grey">Peste Des Petis Ruminants(PPR)</h3>
                    <p><Big>Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), also known as sheep and goat plague,
                      <br>is a highly contagious animal disease affecting domestic and wild small ruminants.
                      <br>It is caused by a virus belonging to the genus Morbillivirus, family Paramixoviridae.</Big></p><img src="image37.jpg" alt="image37.jpg">
                      <h3 style="color:grey">Foot And Mouth Disease</h3>
                      <p><Big>A range of clinical signs may indicate the presence of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in sheep and goats.
                        <br>In sheep and goats, the disease is usually mild with few lesions, however, clinical signs can include: pyrexia.
                        <br>lameness and oral lesions, which are often mild.</Big></p> <img src="image35.jpg" alt="image35.jpg"><img src="image36.jpg" alt="image36.jpg">
                        <h3 style="color:grey">Goat Pox</h3>
                        <p><Big>Goat pox are viral diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, vesicles (rarely),
                          <br>internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus,
                           <br>all of which can infect sheep and goat</Big></p><img src="image38.jpg" alt="image38.jpg">

                           <h3 style="color:grey">Fluke Infection</h3>
                           <p><Big>Fluke can cause disease by damaging the liver, as the immature parasite burrows through the liver tissue.
                          <br>Clinical signs of infection include: progressive weight loss, anaemia, oedema (build of fluid, typically under the jaw) and sudden death.
                              <br>Fluke is typically seen at the end of September until the end of April.</Big></p><img src="image39.jpg" alt="image39.jpg">
                              <h3 style="color:grey">Tape Worm</h3>
                              <p><Big>Tapeworm segments can be seen in the feces of sheep and goats. They have a white, grain-like appearance.
                                <br>Adult worms, often up to a meter or more in length, can be expelled and passed in the environment.
                                <br>Tapeworm eggs can be seen in sheep and goat feces, using the standard worm count procedure.</Big></p><img src="image40.jpg" alt="image40.jpg">
                                <h3 style="color:grey">Coccidiosis</h3>
                                <p><Big>Coccidiosis of goats is caused by various Eimeria species of protozoan parasites.
                                  <br>Transmission of coccidiosis to kids occurs when infected animals shed the organisms in feces, resulting in contaminated feed or water.
                                  <br>Contaminated bedding can be a significant source of infection in a herd.</Big></p>

                                  <p><Big>Effects of ticks in goats. The impacts of ticks on goats include physical effects such as skin irritation, damage to the skin and hide,
                                    <br>limping and wound development.
                                    <br>Ticks further suck blood from goats and thereby predisposing them to anaemia.
                                     <br>In addition, ticks act as vectors for a variety of tick - borne diseases.</Big></p><img src="image41.jpg" alt="image41.jpg">
